# jND2SDK
Java Native Interface (JNI) to the nd2ReadSDK_v9 library for reading the Nikon ND2 image format.

All ND2 library dependencies (for Windows, Mac and Linux) can be downloaded from http://www.nd2sdk.com/ (requires a login)

Displaying a sample ND2 file in Test.java requires ImageJ (e.g., ij-1.50e.jar) to be in your Java build path.

Alternatively, ImageJ can be download from http://imagej.net/Downloads or you can clone the repository from https://github.com/imagej/imagej1.git
